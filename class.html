        <p class="p-1 mt-5"><strong>Fighters</strong> rule many battlefields. Questing knights, royal champions, elite soldiers, and
            hardened mercenaries - as Fighters, they all share an unparalleled prowess with weapons and armor. And they
            are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and defying it.

            Fighters master various weapon techniques, and a well-equipped Fighter always has the right tool at hand for
            any combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is adept with every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of
            familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain styles of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on
            fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination
            of broad ability and extensive specialization makes Fighters superior combatants.</p>

                <h5>Level 1: Second Wind</h5>
                <p>You have a limited well of physical and mental stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action, you
                    can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Fighter level.</p>
                <p>You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you
                    regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                <p>When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second
                    Wind column of the Fighter Features table.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-block">
                <h5>Level 1: Weapon Mastery</h5>
                <p>Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of three kinds of Simple or
                    Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and
                    change one of those weapon choices.</p>
                <p>When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more
                    kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Fighter Features table.</p>
            </div>

                <h5>Level 2: Action Surge</h5>
                <p>You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one
                    additional action, except the Magic action.</p>
                <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. Starting at

                <h5>Level 2: Tactical Mind</h5>
                <p>You have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can
                    expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward success. Rather than regaining Hit Points,
                    you roll 1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check, potentially turning it into a success.
                    If the check still fails, this use of Second Wind isn’t expended.</p>
            </div>

                    at certain Fighter levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features
                    that are of your Fighter level or lower.</p>

                    the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                <p>You can use this feature twice before a Long Rest starting at level 13 and three times before a Long
